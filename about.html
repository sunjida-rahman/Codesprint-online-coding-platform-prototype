    <h2>About CodeSprint</h2>
    <p>
      CodeSprint is an online competitive programming platform where students and programmers can 
      participate in live contests, solve problems, and track their progress. Our goal is to 
      provide an environment similar to platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode but 
      customized for academic and team-based contests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Features include:
      <ul>
        <li>Live contest hosting with scoreboards</li>
        <li>Problem-solving environment with multiple languages</li>
        <li>User profiles and submission tracking</li>
        <li>Fair and transparent evaluation system</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      This project was developed as part of an academic initiative to help students 
      prepare for programming contests and sharpen their problem-solving skills.
